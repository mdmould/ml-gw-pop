This repo contains material for the workshop [Scientific Machine Learning for Gravitational Wave Astronomy](https://icerm.brown.edu/program/topical_workshop/tw-25-smlgwa), 2-6 June 2025.

The [slides.pdf](slides.pdf) introduce three applications of machine learning for population inference of gravitational-wave sources.

There is a Python notebook for each of these applications, which you can run with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) with the following buttons:
- [neural-posterior-estimation.ipynb](neural-posterior-estimation.ipynb)
  [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mdmould/ml-gw-pop/HEAD)
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/mdmould/ml-gw-pop/blob/main/neural-posterior-estimation.ipynb)
- [simulation-based-priors.ipynb](simulation-based-priors.ipynb)
- [variational-inference.ipynb](variational-inference.ipynb)

Alternatively, you can clone the repo and run locally or on a cluster - it is entirely self contained.
